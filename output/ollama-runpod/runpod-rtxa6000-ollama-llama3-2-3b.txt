Test 2 [math2]
Prompt: What are the prime factors of 98765?
Response: To find the prime factors of 98765, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

However, 98765 is an odd number, so we can't divide it by 2. We'll move on to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

After trying a few numbers, we find that 98765 ÷ 5 = 19753.

Now we have 19753, which is also not divisible by 2 or 3. Let's try the next prime number, which is 7.

However, 19753 ÷ 7 doesn't give us a whole number. We'll keep trying until we find a factor.

After some trial and error, we find that 19753 ÷ 13 = 1511 (not divisible by 7).

Moving on to the next prime numbers, we find:

* 1511 ÷ 11 = 137
* 137 is not divisible by any of the remaining prime numbers less than its square root.

So, we have found a prime factorization of 98765: 5 × 13 × 11 × 13 × 17.

Test 3 [math3]
Prompt: Calculate the area of a triangle with base 15 m and height 10 cm.
Response: To calculate the area of a triangle, we use the formula:

Area = (base x height) / 2

First, let's convert the height from centimeters to meters:

10 cm = 0.1 m

Now we can plug in the values:

Area = (15 m x 0.1 m) / 2
= 0.75 m^2

Test 4 [math4]
Prompt: Solve for x: 5x + 3 = 28
Response: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation.

First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

5x + 3 - 3 = 28 - 3
5x = 25

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 5:

(5x) / 5 = 25 / 5
x = 5

So, the value of x is 5.

Test 5 [math5]
Prompt: If you roll two six-sided dice, what is the probability of getting a sum of 8?
Response: To find the probability of rolling a sum of 8 with two six-sided dice, we need to count the number of ways this can happen and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

The possible pairs that add up to 8 are:

(2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), and (6,2)

There are 5 favorable outcomes.

Since each die has 6 sides, there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.

The probability is therefore:

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 5/36

So the probability of getting a sum of 8 with two six-sided dice is 5/36 or approximately 0.139 (rounded to three decimal places).

Test 6 [summary1]
Prompt: Summarise the following article in a short paragraph. "Self-styled as the Erin Brockovich of the Potteries, and described by the court of appeal as “a postman with a penchant for fast cars”, Andrew Wrench is a force to be reckoned with. And while he may not be a household name yet, those who work in the multimillion-pound car-leasing industry will be all too aware of his campaigning zeal. Wrench is one of a small group of motorists who could have won billions of pounds for consumers across the country by taking on two finance companies in the courts. Wrench, 60, who lives in Trentham, Staffordshire with his wife, Louise, 46, and 16-year-old son, Ethan, has no legal training but was motivated to fight his case after he discovered that car finance lenders had been paying commission to the dealerships where he bought two cars – an Audi TT coupe and a BMW 3 Series – without his knowledge. “They were kind of pushing their finance straight away, as they do, because that’s where they make the money on the sale of the car, the interest and everything else linked up,” Wrench said. “Lo and behold, I didn’t know about any secret commissions. Obviously, at that time, it hadn’t been disclosed.” In 2015, he bought the Audi for his wife for £8,995, paying a deposit of £3,000 and financing £5,995 on a 48-month credit agreement. “It was a car that my partner, Louise, had always wanted,” Wrench said. He bought the BMW in 2017 for £9,750, paying a deposit of £1,000 with the balance of £8,750 also financed over 48 months. It was only later, when he went back to work after retiring for a period to look after his parents, that he began to question how much he was repaying on the loans. “I took four years out of work, and the APR was lower, when I returned to work in 2019 the interest rate was higher by 5% and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s strange’,” he said. “So I started reading in depth the paperwork, and came across this clause about commissions.” Wrench, a former miner who also served in the navy, sought legal advice and instructed a Bradford-based firm, Cooper Hall Solicitors. After a months-long legal battle against the billion-dollar FirstRand bank, which started in the county court in Stoke-on-Trent, at the end of last month three judges at the court of appeal ruled in favour of Wrench and two other claimants who had brought similar cases. Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched its own investigation into car financing, seeking to determine whether customers had been charged too much interest on loans, with an update due in May next year. The money-saving expert Martin Lewis said in his newsletter that “a shock [had] exploded through the car finance world” with the judges’ ruling. “That means this is now the law, though if it goes to a supreme court appeal, that could take a different view and overrule it,” Lewis said. “The verdict was unambiguous and said a car sales firm couldn’t lawfully receive commission from a finance firm unless it had the customer’s ‘fully informed consent’. The landmark case may result in finance companies paying out billions in compensation to borrowers. “I’m a very, very determined person,” Wrench said, explaining why he decided to take on two finance companies. “I’m very honest, I have a great deal of integrity, to never let go if I think something’s right.” He added: “It’s made me feel good about it, how I’ve done it, and all those people coming forward to open up some sort of small claim. They’re probably doing it in principle, not for the money, but it is nice to know that they’re going to get their justified rewards.” “I always relate to Erin Brockovich,” Wrench said. “That film captivates you. It shows you. They had a massive law firm … and then the water treatment plant ended up dishing out millions to those genuine people. I think it’s similar.” Jamal Ahmed from Cooper Hall said: “After a lengthy legal battle and the involvement of consumer rights solicitors, we are very pleased with the court of appeal’s decision. “This outcome validates our efforts and underscores the importance of transparency and fairness in financial transactions. It also highlights the necessity of holding financial institutions accountable for their practices. “This ruling is a significant win for consumers across the UK. It sets an important precedent, reinforcing the need for full disclosure in financial agreements to ensure that individuals are informed about any commissions that may influence the terms of their contracts. “We believe this decision will encourage more equitable practices within the car finance industry and empower consumers to make better-informed decisions."
Response: Here is a short summary of the article:

Andrew Wrench, a 60-year-old former miner, has won a court of appeal ruling against two finance companies over secret commissions paid by car-leasing firms without his knowledge. Wrench discovered that commissions were being taken on cars he bought from dealerships and had financed through credit agreements. He took on the finance companies, FirstRand bank and another firm, after realizing he was being charged more interest when he returned to work. The court of appeal ruled in his favor, stating that car sales firms cannot receive commission without customers' informed consent. This landmark case may result in billions of pounds in compensation for consumers across the UK, following a similar vein as Erin Brockovich's case against polluters.

Test 7 [summary2]
Prompt: Summarise the article in a one line sentence. "The Syrian army has withdraw from Homs city in central Syria ahead of a rebel offensive on Saturday night, cutting off Damascus from Bashar al-Assad's coastal strongholds, as a lightning offensive brought rebel factions to the besieged president's doorstep. Videos showed Syrian forces withdrawing from security branches in Homs as insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered city limits. The rebel commander Hassan Abdul-Ghani said that its forces were conducting "combing operations" in the city neighbourhoods to find any Syrian soldiers that remained. The speed at which Homs fell was surprising. The Syrian army had been expected to make a stand to save the city, a strategic asset for the Syrian government, linking it to Tartus and Latakia – provinces where Bashar al-Assad has traditionally enjoyed strong support. The advance came just a week after Islamist insurgents led by HTS retook Aleppo in northern Syria, inspiring rebel factions all across the country to rise up against the Syrian army which offered little resistance. As rebel forces took Homs, opposition factions also continued their approach towards Damascus. Earlier on Saturday, opposition factions in the southern provinces of Daraa and Sweida routed government forces and took control of wide swathes of the districts. By night, opposition fighters had entered Daraya, just 5 miles (8km) from the centre of the capital. Meanwhile, east of Damascus, members of the Free Syrian Army took control of the ancient city of Palmyra. With the fall of Homs to rebels, the Syrian regime had been encircled in Damascus. Opposition forces were advancing towards the capital city from the north, south and east of the country. The highway that linked Damascus to Tartus and Latakia ran through Homs – and has now been cut off by rebel forces.  The government in neighbouring Iraq said that 2,000 Syrian soldiers had fled across the border. Al Jazeera showed footage of Syrian tanks and other military vehicles packed with troops crossing into Iraq. A multi-barrel rocket launcher fires 'We can barely believe what's happening': how Syria's frozen conflict flared into hot war that could topple Assad Read more Russia and Iran, which provided the bulk of military and financial support to the Assad government during the course of Syria's 2011 revolution-turned-civil war, have seemed unwilling to lend support to their ally since the beginning of the rebel operation last week. Hezbollah, the pro-Iran group whose fighters used to bolster the ranks of the Syrian army, has been unable to send a significant number of fighters to help after the heavy defeats it has recently incurred against Israel. In an interview with Iraqi media on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that, while the "resistance would do its duty", it was impossible to predict the fate of Assad. Similarly, the secretary general of Hezbollah, Naim Qassem, said in a speech on Thursday that the group would stand with Assad, but it has yet to provide tangible support to the isolated leader. Without significant Russian air support and Hezbollah's reinforcements, Syrian forces have seemingly melted away in the face of advancing rebels. Leaders of the rebels have called on government forces to defect instead of fighting. “The clashes have been limited to just a few points to pressure regime forces to surrender, with assurances that they would be safe and with emphasis that in the end, we are all sons of one country,” said Yasser al-Mikdad, a commander in the operations room of the Liberation of Damascus, an umbrella organisation for opposition forces in southern Syria. He described the taking of the town of Moadamiya on Saturday in the western countryside of Damascus – about four miles from the Republican Palace – where he said most government forces withdrew before advancing rebels, leaving only 70 Syrian army soldiers. “Instructions were issued to our groups not to engage them and to try to convince them to surrender to avoid bloodshed,” Mikdad said. In newly seized areas, rebels rejoiced in their victory, with videos showing statues of late Syrian president Hafez al-Assad being toppled, and a statue's head tied to a motorcycle and dragged along the road. In videos that the Observer was unable to independently verify, regime police officers took off their uniforms in the middle of the street and walked away in civilian clothing. As rebels swept through towns and cities, they opened the doors to government prisons, notorious for their use of torture. Crowds met dazed-looking detainees, some of whom had been imprisoned for decades, as they stepped outside for the first time in years. In Damascus, residents described scenes of panic amid the uncertainty that reigned over the fate of the Syrian government as rebels beat on the capital's door. Jana, a resident of Damascus who spoke under a pseudonym, said: “Those who have residencies in Lebanon are leaving, lots are fleeing. We ourselves, we could leave but things are happening so quickly. Maybe we start to get ready and gather our things and leave, and maybe something happens and we get stuck, nothing is clear. Syrian state media denied rumours that Assad had fled the capital. "The presidency of the Syrian Arab Republic also confirms that Mr President continues his work and national and constitutional duties from the capital, Damascus," Assad's office said in a statement on Saturday. The dizzying pace of events in Syria and the uncertainty over the fate of its government has left international powers reeling and prompted questions over the geopolitical ramifications. Assad was a key ally of Hezbollah and a vital supplier of the group, which receives much of its resources from Iran via Iraq and Syria. Participants of the Astana process – a peace initiative focused on solving the Syrian crisis – urged a cessation of conflict in Syria at the conclusion of the group's meeting in Doha on Saturday night. In a joint statement, the conference called for "all parties to seek a political solution to the Syrian crisis". Millions of Syrians who fled the violence of the civil war and the government's bloody crackdown on protests in 2011 also watched the rebels' advance anxiously, waiting to see if they may be able to safely return to the country after more than 13 years in exile.
